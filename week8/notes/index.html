  <h1>Week 8 Notes</h1>
  <h2>CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</h2>
  <p>
    The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page.
    Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down.
    The translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from the top:
    transform: translate(45px, -45px);
    <br>
    If you only want to move an element vertically or horizontally, you can use the translatex or translatey functions
    respectively.
    <br>
    To move 45px to the right along the x axis, include:
    transform: translateX(45px);
    <br>
    To move up along the y axis by 30px, include:
    transform: translateY(-30px);
    <br>
    For our ad, we want to move the word “dukes” over to the right when the user hovers over it, as if it had been punched
    by our mustachioed pugilist.
    
    <br>
    Transforms don’t work on inline elements. But that’s easy enough to fix. We’ll just add display: inline-block; to our
    span:
    <br>
    .ad-ad2 h1 span {
    font-size: 30px;
    color: #999999;
    display: inline-block;
    }

  </p>
  <h2>Scaling</h2>
  <p>
    The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. If only one value is
    provided, it will be used for both the x and y values, growing or shrinking your element or pseudo-element while
    maintaining the original aspect ratio.
    <br>
    You can also use the scaleX(x) or scaleY(y) functions. These functions will scale only the horizontal dimensions or only
    the vertical dimensions respectively.
  <br>
  </p>
  <h2>Rotation</h2>
  <p>
    The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value
    .ad-ad2 h1:hover span {
    color: #484848;
    transform: rotate(10deg) translateX(40px) scale(1.5);
    }
    <br>
    We’re rotating our span by ten degrees clockwise—adding to the effect of text that’s just been dealt a powerful
    uppercut. We are declaring the rotation before the translate so that it’s applied first—remember that transforms are
    applied in the order provided. In this case, the span will be rotated 10 degrees, and then moved 40px along the rotated
    x axis.
    <br>

  </p>
  <h2>Skew</h2>
  <p>The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes.</p>
  <h2>Transitions</h2>
  <p>
    Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, essentially providing simple animations.
    Here are the steps to create a simple transition using only CSS:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.</li>
    <li>Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.</li>
    <li>Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties, including:
    transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. We’ll look at each of these
    and how they work shortly.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    You can provide any number of CSS properties to the transition-property declaration, separated by commas. Alternatively,
    you can use the keyword all to indicate that every supported property should be animated as it transitions.
    <br>
    In itself, the transition-property property has no effect; that’s because we still need to specify the duration of the
    transition.

  </p>
  <h2>The transition-duration Property</h2>
  <p>
    The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take: the duration of time it takes to go from the
    default state to the transitioned state. You can specify this either in seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms). We’d like our
    animation to be fairly quick, so we’ll specify 0.2 seconds (0.2s), or 200 milliseconds (200ms):
    <br>
    transition-duration: 0.2s;
  </p>
