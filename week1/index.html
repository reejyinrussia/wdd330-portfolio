                    localStorage is a way to persist data if the user refreshes or navigates away. 
                    You can call localStorage.setItem() and localStorage.getItem() to set/grab the value
                    and persist it.

                    I'm not as familier with localStorage, but there seems like there has got to be a better way to keep data?
